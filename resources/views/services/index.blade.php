Although they are willing to engage with a salesperson, they don’t want to be sold to – customers want to learn. 76% of buyers are willing to have a social media conversation about their pending buying decision.</h4>

                                  <p>Who is your target rich audience? What interests them and where do they get information from to make their decisions?  Who do those people associate with and how are they influenced? How do they use Social Media? Marketers need to understand where to meet their customers online and this now includes the intricacies of Social Media.</p>
                                  <h4>Insight.</h4>
                                  <p>Customers are willing to engage with salespeople early in the buying cycle if they know that they will learn.  What is the insight about your customer’s world that you can teach them? This is the value we bring.</p>
                                  <h4>Channel.</h4>
                                  <p>If we know our most valuable customers are likely to be at the tennis club, then we better learn how to play tennis.  If we know our customers are active LinkedIn users and generally get their information from other subject matter experts on LinkedIn, then we better become prolific users of LinkedIn.</p>

                                  <h4>Content culture.</h4>
                                  <p>Creating a brand culture where everyone including customers, engineers, warehouse, logistics, executives, even suppliers, are invested in contributing to the richness of the brand’s social media activity. By allowing your own customers to create content, it enables more authentic customer focused experiences and connects much more effectively with the hearts and minds of your audience.  It also enables a better flow of content – without the big budgets required for professional video productions.</p>
                                  <h4>Content production.</h4>
                                  <p>Creating a content production plan combining customer designed and professionally made content.  Customers engage with different types of content. We want to reach the most likely prospects to connect and this is best achieved by utilising video. We will also assess blogging, podcasting, articles, recommendations, webinars to get your message across.  Social Matrix has a production process that will minimise cost, help the business insource as much as possible and create an effective content production process to generate engaging content that reaches.</p>
                                  <h4>Content calendar.</h4>
                                  <p>Creating a consistent engagement plan across all relevant content means and channels, utilising curated, professionally produced and/or customer generated content.  This is not about spending a day a month on producing or curating content and another day on scheduling using automation tools, this is about creating a content plan that allows for proper touchpoints and engagement through all social channels. If a customer engages we must connect.</p>

                                  <p>Our client content must consider a pathway to purchase through every piece of content – sometimes explicit sometimes implicit – as we take a customer on a journey.  Remember Social Matrix is generating a business outcome for your brand.</p>
                                  <h4>Framing.</h4>
                                  <p>People connect to people. This means that customers connect to other customers. Social Matrix encourages our partner clients to tell the stories, the real stories of their customers.  Many brands are good at telling the old feature and benefit stories but it does not capture peoples’ hearts – particularly on social media.</p>
                                  <h4>Link to brand value.</h4>
                                  <p>Our content produced, whilst vested in the customer’s world,  will clearly link back to the brand story of the client. Remember Social Matrix is here to sell for you.</p>
